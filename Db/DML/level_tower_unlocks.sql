-- Tower unlock progression per level. A kind with no row is locked on that
-- level; max_tower_level is how far it may be upgraded there.
--
-- Level 1 (Lexington): ranged and melee, one upgrade each (to level 2).
-- Level 3 (Great Bridge): ranged opens to level 3 -- the riflemen level,
-- teaching enfilade fire on the causeway, as at the historical battle.
-- Artillery is locked everywhere for now (no rows), pending its unlock level.
